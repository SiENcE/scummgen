# ScummGEN #

SCUMM was the engine used to run old Lucas Arts adventure games like the Monkey Island series, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, and many others. The goal of this project is to develop a set of editors which will eventually allow the creation of SCUMM based games, just like [ScummC](http://alban.dotsec.net/7.html).

Using these tools, three files are assembled : an "index" file (i.e. tentacle.000), a "resource" file (i.e. tentacle.001) as well as a voice file (MONSTER.SOU). This corresponds to the way "Day of the Tentacle", a SCUMM v6 game, was distributed.

No executable file comes along these two game files - [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org), a famous adventure game interpreter, can be used to run your creations.
